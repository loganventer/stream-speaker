# stream-speaker
Stream Speaker aims to become the go to cross-platform client for reading your live stream chat feeds back to you in real time. You will also be able to pause this stream at any time. We aim to provide a terminal interface that is executable as a deamon or program first and later to add a cross-platform GUI.
